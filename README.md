🔗 QR Code Generator – Python GUI Application
Tools Used: Python, Tkinter, qrcode,

Developed a desktop application using Python and Tkinter that generates QR codes from user-input URLs. The application features a user-friendly interface allowing users to:

🔹 Enter a custom link to generate a QR code.

🎨 Choose custom foreground and background colors for the QR code using a built-in color picker(using tkinter.colorchooser).

💾 Optionally save the QR code as a PNG file with a user-defined name.

👁 Preview the QR code instantly without saving.

🚫 Includes robust input validation and error handling via popup messages for smooth user experience.

This project demonstrates my skills in GUI development, user input handling, third-party library integration, and clean application design.

✅ Successfully implemented and tested with dynamic color configurations and file-saving functionality.
